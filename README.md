####Set up
Fork or download this repo.
Run
```
$ npm install
```

####Usage
You can use this setup to test your units and your jQuery events. Place your JavaScript code in `assets/js/` folder and partials in `spec/fixtures/` folder.

Your specs need to be end with `_spec.js` (e.g. `fizz_buzz_spec.js`)

Run tests with
```
$ npm test
```

####Adding tests
I have included some basic specs and `js` code for you to examine. Basically you need to build up your test environment and tear it down afterwards.
You can have different setups by nesting your `describe` blocks/functions.

```javascript
# spec/my_spec.js
describe("Given my code", function () {

	beforeEach(function () {
		/* ... Set up your test ... */
	});

	afterEach(function () {
		/* ... Tear it down ... */
	});

	describe("When ...", function () {

		beforeEach(function () {
		  /* ... Context specific setup ... */
		});

		it("Then...", function () {
			expect(true).toEqual(true);
		});
	});
});
